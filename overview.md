## 1. Values, Types, and Operators
Resources:

[Eloquent JavaScript Ch. 1](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)

[String Methods](/resources/string_methods.md)

[Crash Course onTypes](/resources/type_crash_course.md)

### Check For Understanding
#### Types
1. JavaScript has how many different types?
2. List all types.
3. Declare a variable of each type.

#### Strings
4. What is a string?
5. Define your own unique string.
6. Write code to access the third letter in your string.
7. Use a built-in string method to capitalize your string's every letter.
8. Use a built-in string method to lowercase your string's every letter.

```javascript
let basicTrainingString = "Basic Training";
```

9.  Find the index of the letter "T" in basicTrainingString.

```javascript
basicTrainingString.lastIndexOf('i');
```

10. What does the above code return?
11. Using string.slice, return "Basic".
12. Using string.slice, return "Training".

## 2. Program Structure

[Eloquent JavaScript Ch. 2](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)

### Check For Understanding
#### Conditionals
1. Write a conditional
2. Write another conditional.  In plain language, explain your conditional code.
3. Write an if-else conditional.
4. Write an if -- else if -- else conditional.

#### For-Loops
5. Write a for-loop that logs 1 through 100 to the console.
6. Write a for-loop that logs EVEN NUMBERS 1-100 to the console.
7. Write a DECREMENTING for-loop that logs 100 through 1 to the console.

## 3. Functions
[Eloquent JavaScript Ch. 3](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)

[Intro To Functions](/resources/string_methods.md)

[Basic Use of Function](/resources/string_methods.md)

[Defining Functions](/resources/type_crash_course.md)

### Check For Understanding
1. What is the basic anatomy of a function?
2. In two different styles, write a basic function called "basicFunction".  First time use "function definition".  Second time use "function expression".

From now on, write your functions in the "function definition" style.

## 4. Objects and Arrays

[Eloquent JavaScript Ch. 4](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)

[Intro To Arrays](/resources/intro_to_arrays)

[MDN's Object Intro](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

### Check For Understanding (Arrays I)
1. Write an array called "fruits" which contains three different fruits.
2. How can I access the second piece of fruit in fruits array?
3. Use simple array methods to add fruit to the fruits array.
4. Use simple array methods to remove fruit from the fruits array.
5. What means fruits.length?

```javascript
let pizzaTypes = ['deepDish','Neapolitan','thinCrust','bad'];
```

### Check For Understanding (Arrays II)
1. How to access 'Neapolitan'?  And 'bad'?
2. Add a few elements in pizzaTypes array.  Remove 'thinCrust'.
3. What are the four most common array methods for adding / removing elements?
4. Give code examples of all four.
5. Use the concat method on pizzaTypes.  Note: You will need to create another array.
6. Use join to turn an array into a string.  Use split to turn string into array.
7. Use Math.floor and Math.random to generate random integers.

### Check For Understanding (Objects I)
1. What's a key-value pair?  Make an object to illustrate.
2. What's the difference between objects and arrays?
3. Create an object using object literal syntax.
4. Add and access values using both bracket and dot notation.
5. Combine objects with arrays.  Combine arrays with objects.

### Check For Understanding (Objects II)
1. Create an empty object called "pet".
2. To your pet object, add "name", "color", "age", and "isFavorite" key-value pairs.  "name" and "color" type are strings.  "age" is a number.  "isFavorite" is boolean.
3. To "pet" object, use dot notation to add another key-value pair.  You choose specifics.
4. To "pet" object, use bracket notation to add another key-value pair.  You choose specifics.
